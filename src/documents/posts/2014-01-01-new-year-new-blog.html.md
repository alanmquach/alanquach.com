For someone who has been so deeply interested in web design and "cutting edge" web technologies since before I can remember, it has certainly taken me far too long to finally build my personal website.

Perhaps that was a bit unfair, as I'd previous had a living, breathing blog when I was a teenager where I would blog about, well, things that teenagers blog about. And prior to that, who could forget the [geocities](http://geocities.com) sites that we all started with. **But I don't really count those.**

For the better half of the decade and then some, I've been wanting to get more serious about building a proper personal website. Partly to (professionally, I suppose) showcase my work, partly so to have an online place to call home, but mostly just because I need a canvas to channel my curiousity about all these new web technologies, techniques, and frameworks; and work or building examples for the purpose of learning can only really get you so far.

### Plot twist

So here we are today, when I've finally started (and hopefully finish) writing the first real content of [alanquach.com](/). And I can attribute this small step to my stark realization that all these years, I've simply been guilty of one of my biggest pet peeves: *attempting to build some complete masterpiece, refusing to go live with anything less than that grand vision and failing to achieve even a sliver of something useful*.

Allow me to elaborate.

Every step along the way, I had wanted to:
* Build some crazy extravagant Flash project, because Flash was cool
* Come up with my own PHP/MySQL blogging system with comments and stuff, because I could
* Or build from scratch a Node.js framework to [*see above bullet*]

I was doing [waterfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)!!! Once I had realized that, the solution was simple. And it was I'd been preaching all along anyways:
* Plan well (but don't go overboard)
* Divide into SMART chunks and prioritize
* **Ship. Ship fast.**

So while I have some grand plans for what will become of this website or blog, I was still able to go live with something in less than a day's time. And now that I've gotten the ball rolling, I can't wait to pack some real fun stuff into it.

It's highly unlikely that you'll be reading this post in it's original incarnation (unless you checkout my [initial commit](https://github.com/integsrtite/alanquach.com/commit/d4f27b018c7ba56d87e4fa3b95980e27caebd435)), so just use your imagination as I describe it to you... it's pure HTML markup, no CSS, no fonts, rendered in Times New Roman.

It's going to be a great year.
